Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.6.2.txt

v.6.2.0

- orbs of crafting was moved to library of exile mod so it's not needed anymore
- the harvest now a separate required dependency (I tried to make it an optional dependency but was a bit too difficult, I might try to jarjar it again later)
- adventure maps are now a separate required dependency called: dungeon realm
- old dimension will stay as an empty dimension so future saves aren't borked by its removal
- return to old map item system meaning: maps drop again, no more upgrading, but i made map boss always drop 1 map
- uber maps changed slightly, now maps can become uber maps with an orb item, crafted with 4 uber frags, but the map must be mythic for the orb to be used
- map mobs now drop vanilla loot again, this was removed due to item clutter, but will clash with the dungeon mod features now possibly
- builder note: map boss arenas now need the 'map_teleporter' block
- builder note2: harvest maps now use harvest_spawner blocks placed around the map instead of the league processor;32 something block
- the map dimension no longer puts you in adventure mode, now uses events to make sure you can't place/break etc, report any bugs please!
- new feature, command blocks should no longer show in maps
- other dimension mod addons for dungeon realm now connect the maps, um. That means if you enter a harvest/obelisk etc through a map, it counts as your map too
- changed dungeon datapack json, now require all types of rooms and no more fallback rooms
- changed rarity json, map finish rarity is now a separate datapack under library mod
- removed spawned mobs, now use mob lists from library mod
- datapack checker now works for any of library's datapacks, not just mns
- ailment procs now show damage chat messages when applied
- buffed gathering profession dropchances at early levels by reducing the effect of exp to loot multiplier by half
Now all gathers count as if they have an extra 50 experience. So if say you're mining a block that gives 10 exp, you'd before have 0.1x loot multi,
now you'd have 0.6x loot multi. For a block that gives 200 exp, loot multi was 2x before, now it's 2.5x
- as maps are now drops again, added a currency that allows you to upgrade map rarity
- removed map lives system, possibly temporary

New Feature: Relics!
- the map device can now be equipped with relics
- relics boost your maps with stats like mob pack size, chance to contain additional harvest etc
- relics currently drop once per map boss and 3 per uber boss
