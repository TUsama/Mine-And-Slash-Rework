v.6.1.0

- big refactor to a lot of code, specifically currencies, now called crafting orbs.
Orbs of Crafting is now a separate dependency mod and will be used in my other mods, hopefully coming soon
- fixed soul cleaner config
- set scale to nearest player true by default
- fixed leech cap stat scaling: normal > none
- maybe fix compat config resetting
- hp bars now show magic shield
- should check some 'is teamed' methods to work even when far away, so friendly traps dont turn on you as soon as the friend teleports away
- if youre lacking resists in map you'll now take 10% of your hp as damage per second and you wont regenerate any resource
- spectators now dont count as nearest players
- messed with recipe gen code, report if any recipes are missing please
- one of a kind should now work for effects
- tp to caster spell action added
